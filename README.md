# NHL-KDE-Heatmap-Generator

This is KDE heatmap generator for NHL shooting data. The program is written in a python jupyter notebook and 
makes use of the matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, scipy, and ipywidgets modules.

This notebook takes two names of players and compares where either their goals, shots, misses, or shot attempts are
taken. You can choose between these types with the help of the interactive dropdown. The notebook also has the
ability to filter the events for just even strength situations, powerplay situations, or all situations.

There is more information available within the actual notebook named shot.ipynb.
